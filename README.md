# Genes
"This is a small script to read a string and count the amino acid from the 3 base pairs of Adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine."
First it splits the string into 3 base pairs Ex: ATCGUA -> ATC|GUA
Then it checks for differences between the two strings then if it finds a differences it adds it to a new list where then it counts certain amino acid
Future goals is to be able to read from FASTA file and to be able to count all the amino acids.
